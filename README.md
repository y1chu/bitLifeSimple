# Life Simulator Game

This is a text-based game where you make choices and try to navigate through life. You start with three attributes: happiness, health, and wealth. As you progress through the game, your choices will affect these attributes, and you may gain or lose points in each category.

## How to Play

At each event, you will be presented with a choice. Read the description and choose the option that you think is best. Each choice has different outcomes, which can affect your attributes in different ways.

If your attributes ever reach 0 or below, you may die. The game will randomly determine whether or not you survive. If you don't make it, you will have to start over from the beginning.
